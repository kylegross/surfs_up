# SurfsUp Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy with more information about temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. This data will be used to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
There are three key differences in the weather between June and December (graphs below):
#### June temperatures:

#### December temperatures:

1. With the standard deviation of June temperatures was 3.25 degrees Farenheit, and the standard deviation of December temperatures was a bit higher at 3.75 in December. This accounts for the larger variance in temperatures during the month of December.

2. The minimum temperature in June was recorded as 64 degrees Farenheit, while the minimum temperature in December was a chilling 56 degrees Farenheit.

3. The maximum temperature in June was recorded as 85 degrees Farenheit, while the maximum temperature in December was a two-degree difference at 83 degrees Farenheit.

## Summary
As reviewed in the analysis results, the weather between June and December in Oahu remains generally consistent. Although there is an average three degree difference between these two months (as seen in the above graphics), the weather is not very temperament and supports the argument that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The most variance can be seen in the minimum recorded temperatures, and in December the 56 degree minimum can partially be attributed to daylight-savings and the decreased amount of available daylight.
That said, two additional queries that should be performed to gather more weather data for June and December are percent cloud cover and percent windiness. These two data points will help to provide a more complete picture of the weather analysis, with the assumed trend that less persons purchase ice cream and/or go surfing during cloudy and/or windy weather. An analysis of just the temperature does not provide a complete picture of the weather in Oahu. I think that this analysis would provide some explanation for the large variation in minimum temperatures between the two months.
